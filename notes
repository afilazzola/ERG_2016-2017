## New Analyses

Positive interactions respond non-linearly to a gradient of aridity driven by winter rainfall

Species with a mesic niche are more likely to be facilitated than species with an arid niche.

Nutrients will be higher in the shrub, but limitations in water availabilty limit the ability for annuals to use them.

Shrubs had little effect at hyper arid sites with no difference relative to open sites for community biomass, richness, or annual composition. However, shrubs significant affected community composition with decreasing aridity by reducing species richness, favouring non-native dominance, and increasing annual biomass.
