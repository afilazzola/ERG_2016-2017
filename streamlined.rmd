#### Abstract

An under-examined component of the shrub-annual relationship is how regional drivers, such as climate, may alter the sign or magnitude of positive interactions. Interspecific interactions between plants have been shown to be strongly linked to climate, particularly temperature and precipitation. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that higher abiotic stress (i.e. for deserts, increasing temperature and reduced precipitation) will increase the frequency of positive interactions among shrubs and their annual understory. Regional climate gradients also have indirect effects on plant composition, such as determining consumer abundance and soil nutrient composition. Nutrient availability is particularly affected by precipitation because of altered decomposition rates of organic matter and mineralization. Therefore, the strength of facilitation and operating mechanism of a shrub on the annual plant community may change along a regional gradient. 

#### Hypothesis

Shrubs facilitate annual plant productivity in deserts and this effect will increase with aridity.

##combine nutrients, weather, and shrub traits

site.vars <- data.frame(weather.vars[,3:7],nutrients.vars[,5:7])
row.names(site.vars) <- weather.vars[,1]

## PCA of site characteristics

pca1 <- prcomp(log(site.vars))

row.names(shrubs.vars) <- shrubs.vars[,1]
pca2 <- prcomp(log(shrubs.vars[,3:7]))
